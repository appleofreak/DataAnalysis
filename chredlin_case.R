#Redlining is when they refuse to sell houses to certain people
#We do not know the race of those denied insurance, we only know their racial composition in a zip code
#Hence we cannot simply expect any correlation (if found) to extend to an individual level from the group relations

#Inferences from summary below
#1. Wide range in race variable between minimum and maximum value
#2. Assuming all zip codes are not homogenous ie it is not impossible to derive meaning from this data
#3. Skewness in theft and income
#4. Weird behavior of involact, high number of zeroes, hard to draw any standalone inference

#Involact represents the new FAIR plan policies and renewals per 100 housing units
#Model1 demonstartes how homeowners in Zip codes with high percentage of minorities are taking the default FAIR plam insurance at a higher rate compared to the others.

#We also have fire and theft as factors that could be denying insurnace so it is too soon to jump to any conclusion just yet

summary (model3)
#A common practice is to use log(income) instead of income, that helps solve the skewness 
#1. Income is also a measure where elasticity depends hence taking log helps deal with the elasticity
#2. Income is more multipliable than addable
#Accouting for that
model3 <- lm(involact ~ race + fire + theft + age + log(income), chredlin)

model.south <- lm(involact ~ race+fire+theft+age, subset = (side=="s"), chredlin)
summary (model.south)
#Effect of race shows more in North than it does in South



#Short conclusion: whereas there is some relationship between the fire scare and involact, there still seems to be a strong evidence of race for redlining

#Some other questions
#1. Number of people affected is small to be generalized
#2. Missing variable, say people having performed poorly during their insurnace interviews etc
#3. We saw the division between north and south, what if it is further divided into even smaller segments and we see this is prevalent in a very small part in the north and not widespread at all?

#Hence despite having a very solid relation here, we still cannot be sure enough to simply link race to redlining because the above questions remain unaswered based on the data we have.
