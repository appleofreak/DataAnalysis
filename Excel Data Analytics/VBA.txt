Store data -> Manipulate Data -> Output
Object oriented programming: Everything is an object and has some properties ie what it is , they also have methods ie can do etc, each method leads to an event
Object (Property, Method, Event)

Excel Object Model is all about the language
Application Object: Top level
1. Properties: Version ie 2016 etc, Captions, Default file path, Workbooks
2. Methods: Calculate, check spelling, quit
3. Events: SheetCalculate, NewWorkbook, WorkbookBeforeClose
Workbook Object
1. Properties: Name, Sheet, Saved
2. Methods: PrintOut, Close
3. Events: BeforeClose, NewSheet, BeforeSave
Worksheet Object
1. Properties: Name, UsedRange(all used not existing, even deleted), Visible
2. Methods: Activate (currently working ie displayed on screen), Copy, Delete
3. Event: Activate, Deactivate, Change

I. Go to View, View Macros to start writing
Here you can select if the macro needs to apply to individual sheets or the whole workbook.
If you have multiple workbooks open, you'll see all of them there
Here, you'll have actions, events and properties

To see what all you can do on the objects, 
Object Browser>Search for something, say workbook> Look at "Members of workbook"
These members are everything you can do on it.

In the VBA editor>Tools>Project properties: you can write down what it does and make it password protected


Subroutine != Functions
can write values but cannot use subroutines in formula
can use function in formula

In your code module, every Sub routine works differently, you can chose which one you want to work with.
You can also make declerations like global variables here.































































Code Appendix:

1. Writing a macro that saves if not saved

Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)If Me.Saved = False Then Me.SaveEnd Sub
